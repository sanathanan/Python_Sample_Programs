Find Triplets with zero sum

Given an array arr[] of n integers. Check whether it contains a triplet that sums up to zero.

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the boolean function findTriplets()
which takes the array arr[] and the size of the array (n) as inputs and print 1 if the function returns true
else print 0 if the function returns false.

Example:
Input: n = 5, arr[] = {0, -1, 2, -3, 1}
Output: 1
Explanation: 0, -1 and 1 forms a triplet with sum equal to 0.

Example:
Input: n = 3, arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
Output: 0
Explanation: No triplet with zero sum exists.
