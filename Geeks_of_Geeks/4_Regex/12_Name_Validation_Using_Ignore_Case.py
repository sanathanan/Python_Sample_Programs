"""
Name Validation Using IgnoreCase

UseCase:
Letâ€™s consider an example of a form where the user is asked to enter their name and we have to validate it using RegEx.
The format for entering name is as follow:

Mr. or Mrs. or Ms. (Either one) followed by a single space
First Name, followed by a single space
Middle Name(optional), followed by a single space
Last Name(optional)

Example:
Input : Mr. Albus Severus Potter
Output : Valid

Input : Lily and Mr. Harry Potter
Output : Invalid
